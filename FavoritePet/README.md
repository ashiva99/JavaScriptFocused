# Favorite Pet

This is a small web project that displays a picture of a dog and allows the user to highlight the image by changing its border color.

## Project Structure

```
index.html
css/
    styles.css
images/
    dog.jpg
js/
    main.js
```

### Files

1. **index.html**  
   This is the main HTML file that structures the webpage. It includes:
   - An image of a dog (`dog.jpg`).
   - A button labeled "Highlight" that changes the border color of the image when clicked.

2. **css/styles.css**  
   This file contains the styles for the webpage:
   - The background is black.
   - The image has a gray border by default.
   - The layout is centered using flexbox.

3. **js/main.js**  
   This file contains the JavaScript function `changeBorderColor()`. When the "Highlight" button is clicked, it changes the border color of the image to yellow.

4. **images/dog.jpg**  
   This is the image of the dog displayed on the webpage.

## How It Works

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. You will see a centered image of a dog with a gray border.
3. Click the "Highlight" button to change the border color of the image to yellow.

## Purpose

This project is a simple demonstration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working together to create an interactive webpage.
