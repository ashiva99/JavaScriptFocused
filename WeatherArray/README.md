## Features

- Displays the current day's weather with a message.
- Randomly generates weather for each day of the week.
- Dynamically updates the background and styles based on the weather type.
- Styled weather cards for each day with background images and text overlays.

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage, including a container for the weather cards.
2. **CSS**: The `style.css` file styles the webpage, ensuring the content is centered and visually appealing.
3. **JavaScript**: The `script.js` file generates random weather for each day of the week and dynamically updates the DOM with styled weather cards.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the app.


## File Paths for Assets

- **GIFs**: Located in the `gifs/` folder.
- **Images**: Located in the `images/` folder.

## Known Issues

- Ensure the file paths for the images and GIFs are correct relative to the `css/style.css` file.
- If the background images or GIFs do not load, verify the folder structure and file names.
